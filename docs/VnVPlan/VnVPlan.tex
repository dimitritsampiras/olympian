	\section{General Information}
	
	\subsection{Summary}
	
	%\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
	%	its general functions.}
	
	The software being tested is a mobile application called Olympian. It is a workout application with a social component.
	Important components of the software that will be getting tested are:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item The functionality to log in and sign up new users. This will function to allow users to create a customized experience with data being saved over between uses.
		\item The functionality for users to create and upload their own workouts. Specifically, users should be able to set a workout category, outline steps for their workout plan, and include videos and images to support the exercise.
		\item The functionality for users to discover new and popular workouts that have been created by other users. Users should be able to sort by new or trending and filter by the muscle groups that they would like to target.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Objectives}
	
	%\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
	%	the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
	%	something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
	%	``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
	%	just those that are most important.}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Demonstrate ease of use for new users to sign in.
			\item Show off intuitiveness and learnability of the workout creation process.
			\item Demonstrate usability of workout feed. Newly created workouts must appear in this feed.
			\item Support the claim that our client shall update the server and vice versa in under 10 seconds under average North American internet speeds.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Relevant Documentation}
	
	%\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
	%	and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
	%	can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
	%	is done, they will be written.}

	% \wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
	% 	come.}
	
	\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

	% \wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
	% 	You shoud do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
	% 	for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

	\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}
	% \wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may include
	% 	ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may plan for 
	% 	something more rigorous/systematic.}
	% \wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

	The SRS will be evaluated by team members and classmates as the project progresses. It will also be verified through testing with a traceability matrix.
	GitHub issues left by other groups will be carefully considered and addressed.
	The following checklist will be used:
	\begin{todolist}
		\item Can the system clearly demonstrate each requirement?
		\item Can the system demonstrate each requirement outside of a testing or debugging environment?
		\item Does each requirement map to one or more tests?
	\end{todolist}
	
	\subsection{Design Verification Plan}
	% \wss{Plans for design verification}
	% \wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}
	% \wss{Create a checklists?}

	The project design will be manually reviewed by each team member and classmates. The following checklist will be used:
	\begin{todolist}
		\item Does the system design allow for each functional and non functional requirement to be met?
		\item Does the chosen architecture(s) make sense for the given use cases? Does it allow for easy scalability?
		\item Does the design follow appropriate design principles (e.g. low coupling, high cohesion, separation of concerns)?
	\end{todolist}
	
	\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}
	% \wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be verified.}
	% \wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}
	% \wss{Create a checklists?}

	The Verification and Validation Plan artifact will be read and reviewed by each team member according to the following checklist:
	\begin{todolist}
		\item Are there any missing or empty sections?
		\item Is each section complete with sufficient detail?
		\item Are there any contradictions between sections?
		\item Is the table of contents present and reflective of the document's sections?
		\item Is the revision history up to date?
		\item Are there any typos in the document?
	\end{todolist}
	GitHub issues left by other groups will be carefully considered and addressed.
	
	\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}
	
	% \wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
	% 	testing plan.}
	
	% \wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static verification of
	% 	the implementation.  Potential techniques include code walkthroughs, code
	% 	inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

	Implementation Verification will be done according to the functional and non-functional tests listed in this document.
	Code additions will be thoroughly reviewed by team members in feature branches before merging with the main branch.
	Linters and formatters will be utilized to ensure code consistency.
	
	\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}
	
	See Section 3.5 of Problem Statement.
	% \wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
	% 	framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
	% 	include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
	% 	tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
	% 	Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
	% 	you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
	% 	that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
	% 	Python.}
	% \wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
	% 	that document.}
	% \wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
	% 	implementation.}
	
	\subsection{Software Validation Plan}
	% \wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
	% 	point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
	% 	here.}
	% \wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
	% 	the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
	% 	inspection?}
	% \wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}
	No external data will be used for validation. In addition to the SRS verification checklist, meetings will be held with stakeholders to ensure
	requirements cover all desired tests.

		philosophy for test case selection.}  
	\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
		document) has been completed.}
	
	\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}
	
	\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
		developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
		verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
		have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
		explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}
	
	\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}
	
	\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
		appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
		technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}
	
	\subsubsection{Module 1}
	
	\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
		References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
		perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
		tests were selected.}

	\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}
	
	\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
		performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
		nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

	\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}
	
	The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
	graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
		successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
		Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
		static testing knowledge, specific tool usage etc.  You should look to
		identify at least one item for each team member.
		\item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
		question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
		mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
		member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
