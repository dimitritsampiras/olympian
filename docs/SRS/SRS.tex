\section{Project Drivers}
\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
  \subsubsection{The User Business or Background of the Project Effort}
  \noindent
  With the increase in media consumption across the world, there has been a greater focus on several previously underrepresented or inaccessable niches, such as health and fitness. Despite the growth and presence of fitness in social media, there are still large barriers to entry that make it intimidating to get started or get accurate information that would aid individuals in their fitness journeys. A lot of the media available online is either behind a paywall, or structured in undigestible video and written formats. The lack of a free, centralized system that contains media generated and verified by fitness enthusiasts alike spurred the idea for this application. This application aims to bridge the gap that exists in the online fitness world by allowing individuals to create and track workouts of their own, search and share workouts created by others, and review and discuss what they find personally works and doesn't work for them. Creating a collaborative online fitness environment allows individuals to start or expand their fitness journey without looking in numerous locations or paying money for programs that may not work for them. 
\subsection{Stakeholders}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Fitness Enthusiasts - Anyone interested in exploring other fitness routines, creating their own routines, and tracking their own personal progression towards goals.
	\item Personal Trainers - Olympian provides the ideal platform for trainers to share routines and goals with their clients.
	\item Fitness Advertisers - One avenue of monetization that Olympian could take is running advertisements. Although these advertisements could fall into any category, the largest stakeholders will be Fitness Advertisers,
	as the users of Olympian will be heavily involved with fitness, and thus most likely to buy fitness products.
\end{enumerate}

Description: The system shall allow the user to add and remove individual exercises in order to a created workout routine, with a maximum of 20 exercises per workout routine.
\\ Rationale: A workout routine is composed of a sequence of exercises performed in order, which the user should be able to add and remove as they wish to create the desired routine.
\\ Fit Criterion: The user is able to add and remove exercises from a created workout routine.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Inputs}:]
Description: The system shall allow the user to add or remove quantifiers to a given exercise.
\\ Rationale: A single exercise requires quantifiers including but not limited to sets, reps, weight (light, medium, heavy), time, rest time to adequately specify how it is to be performed within a given routine.
\\ Fit Criterion: The user is able to add quantifiers to a given exercise.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Inputs}:]
Description: The system shall allow the user to publicly post a workout routine.
\\ Rationale: To be able to display their workout routine to other users.

\plt{Every IM should map to at least one requirement, but not every requirement
  has to map to a corresponding IM.}

\section{Nonfunctional Requirements}

\plt{List your nonfunctional requirements.  You may consider using a fit
  criterion to make them verifiable.}
\plt{The goal is for the nonfunctional requirements to be unambiguous, abstract
  and verifiable.  This isn't easy to show succinctly, so a good strategy may be
to give a ``high level'' view of the requirement, but allow for the details to
be covered in the Verification and Validation document.}
\plt{An absolute requirement on a quality of the system is rarely needed.  For
  instance, an accuracy of 0.0101 \% is likely fine, even if the requirement is
  for 0.01 \% accuracy.  Therefore, the emphasis will often be more on
  describing now well the quality is achieved, through experimentation, and
  possibly theory, rather than meeting some bar that was defined a priori.}
\plt{You do not need an entry for correctness in your NFRs.  The purpose of the
  SRS is to record the requirements that need to be satisfied for correctness.
  Any statement of correctness would just be redundant. Rather than discuss
  correctness, you can characterize how far away from the correct (true)
  solution you are allowed to be.  This is discussed under accuracy.}

				\item JEFIT lets you create and track workouts. It does not feature user-generated content but has paid template programs. It has functionality allowing users to post progress pictures. 
				\item JEFIT could be used as a foundation for adding required features if acquired.
				\end{itemize}
		
			\subsubsection{Reusable Components}
		
				\noindent One Rep Max Calculator
				\begin{itemize}
				\item The npm library one-rep-max, can be used to satisfy the requirements of providing user statistics. The library offers multiple recognized methods of calculating users' maximum weight for one repetition. 
				\item Event: Track Personal Quantifiers 
				\end{itemize}
				
				\noindent Content-Based Recommender 
				\begin{itemize}
				\item The npm library content-based-recommender can help display recommended content for the user based on user inputted parameters.
				\item This addresses the business event "filter routines". 
				\end{itemize}
		
			\subsubsection{Products that can be copied}
		
				\noindent Exercise Directory
				\begin{itemize}
				\item Exercise Directory provides a bulk directory of various exercises that can be directly copied as there is no legal ownership of an exercise.
				\end{itemize}
		
				\noindent HyperHuman API 
				\begin{itemize}
				\item HyperHuman API offers pre-built workout programs that can be used as basic templates. This is especially useful in the beginning stages of the app where user generated content is at a low. 
				\item This addresses the business event "browse programs". 
				\end{itemize}
		
		\subsection{New Problems}
			Not applicable.
		\subsection{Tasks}
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Determine which technologies will be used for the creation of this project (frontend framework, server language).
			\item  Design UX wire-frames for the application.
			\item  Design UI design mockups for the application.
			\item  Design UI components and testing for the application with front-end technology.
			\item  Create skeleton of API
			\item  Revise requirement documents.
			\item  Implement test report
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
			The product will be deployed to the Apple App store first, then it will be added to the Google Play store once it has run without issue on the app store.
			This project is new, so no transition period is relevant.
		\subsection{Risks}
			\begin{itemize}
			\item User data breach. If users' data is leaked, there would be damaging ramifications on our reputation and our userbase.
			\item Failure of content moderation. Olympian is a social media application and as such is susceptible to being used for nefarious and hateful purposes. This is why content moderation will be vital in running this application.
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Costs}
			\begin{itemize}
			\item The cost of keeping a server that is always responsive to client requests. This has an estimated cost of \$25 per month.
			\item The cost of utilizing a database that can handle many reads and writes quickly. This has an estimated cost of \$10 per month.
			\item The cost of an Individual Developer Account needed to host all apps on the Apple App Store. This will cost USD\$99.
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
			N/A
		\subsection{Waiting Room}
			\begin{itemize}
			\item The product must allow users to track their diet information and recommend diets based on calory intake.
			\item The product must algorithmically produce a "Recommended" feed filled with workouts selected for users based on their habits and interests.
			\item The product must include an optional networking feature where users can view the growth of similar users and track the steps taken to produce those improvements.
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
			The product should be built using React Native along with an Express.js backend and utilizing the Google Firestore suite for app management including database and storage. Pricing was collected with these services in mind and they fullfil the needs of the product.

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:trace} shows the
dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, and
instance models with each other. Table~\ref{Table:R_trace} shows the
dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each
other. Table~\ref{Table:A_trace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, and likely changes on
the assumptions.

\plt{You will have to modify these tables for your problem.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is not generally symmetric.  If GD1 uses A1, that
  means that GD1's derivation or presentation requires invocation of A1.  A1
  does not use GD1.  A1 is ``used by'' GD1.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is challenging to maintain manually.  Please do
  your best.  In the future tools (like Drasil) will make this much easier.}

The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on
what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  The
arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an
arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a
component is changed, the components that it points to should also be
changed. Figure~\ref{Fig_ATrace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, likely changes, and
assumptions on each other. Figure~\ref{Fig_RTrace} shows the dependencies of
instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each other.
