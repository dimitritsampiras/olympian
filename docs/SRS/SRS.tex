\section{Project Drivers}
\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
  \subsubsection{The User Business or Background of the Project Effort}
  \noindent
  With the increase in media consumption across the world, there has been a greater focus on several previously underrepresented or inaccessable niches, such as health and fitness. Despite the growth and presence of fitness in social media, there are still large barriers to entry that make it intimidating to get started or get accurate information that would aid individuals in their fitness journeys. A lot of the media available online is either behind a paywall, or structured in undigestible video and written formats. The lack of a free, centralized system that contains media generated and verified by fitness enthusiasts alike spurred the idea for this application. This application aims to bridge the gap that exists in the online fitness world by allowing individuals to create and track workouts of their own, search and share workouts created by others, and review and discuss what they find personally works and doesn't work for them. Creating a collaborative online fitness environment allows individuals to start or expand their fitness journey without looking in numerous locations or paying money for programs that may not work for them. 
\subsection{Stakeholders}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Fitness Enthusiasts - Anyone interested in exploring other fitness routines, creating their own routines, and tracking their own personal progression towards goals.
	\item Personal Trainers - Olympian provides the ideal platform for trainers to share routines and goals with their clients.
	\item Fitness Advertisers - One avenue of monetization that Olympian could take is running advertisements. Although these advertisements could fall into any category, the largest stakeholders will be Fitness Advertisers,
	as the users of Olympian will be heavily involved with fitness, and thus most likely to buy fitness products.
\end{enumerate}

\plt{Every IM should map to at least one requirement, but not every requirement
  has to map to a corresponding IM.}

\section{Nonfunctional Requirements}

\plt{List your nonfunctional requirements.  You may consider using a fit
  criterion to make them verifiable.}
\plt{The goal is for the nonfunctional requirements to be unambiguous, abstract
  and verifiable.  This isn't easy to show succinctly, so a good strategy may be
to give a ``high level'' view of the requirement, but allow for the details to
be covered in the Verification and Validation document.}
\plt{An absolute requirement on a quality of the system is rarely needed.  For
  instance, an accuracy of 0.0101 \% is likely fine, even if the requirement is
  for 0.01 \% accuracy.  Therefore, the emphasis will often be more on
  describing now well the quality is achieved, through experimentation, and
  possibly theory, rather than meeting some bar that was defined a priori.}
\plt{You do not need an entry for correctness in your NFRs.  The purpose of the
  SRS is to record the requirements that need to be satisfied for correctness.
  Any statement of correctness would just be redundant. Rather than discuss
  correctness, you can characterize how far away from the correct (true)
  solution you are allowed to be.  This is discussed under accuracy.}

      \item N/A
    \end{itemize}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Accuracy}:]
  \textbf{Accuracy} \plt{Characterize the accuracy by giving the context/use for
    the software.  Maybe something like, ``The accuracy of the computed
    solutions should meet the level needed for $<$engineering or scientific
    application$>$.  The level of accuracy achieved by \progname{} shall be
    described following the procedure given in Section~X of the Verification and
    Validation Plan.''  A link to the VnV plan would be a nice extra.}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Usability}:] \textbf{Usability}
  \plt{Characterize the usability by giving the context/use for the software.
    You should likely reference the user characteristics section.  The level of
    usability achieved by the software shall be described following the
    procedure given in Section~X of the Verification and Validation Plan.  A
    link to the VnV plan would be a nice extra.}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Maintainability}:]
  \textbf{Maintainability} \plt{The effort required to make any of the likely
    changes listed for \progname{} should be less than FRACTION of the original
    development time.  FRACTION is then a symbolic constant that can be defined
    at the end of the report.}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Portability}:]
  \textbf{Portability} \plt{This NFR is easier to write than the others.  The
    systems that \progname{} should run on should be listed here.  When possible
    the specific versions of the potential operating environments should be
    given.  To make the NFR verifiable a statement could be made that the tests
    from a given section of the VnV plan can be successfully run on all of the
    possible operating environments.}

\item Other NFRs that might be discussed include verifiability,
  understandability and reusability.

	\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}
	
	The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
	has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
	component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
	with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:trace} shows
	the
	dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, and
	instance models with each other. Table~\ref{Table:R_trace} shows the
	dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each
	other. Table~\ref{Table:A_trace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
	general definitions, data definitions, instance models, and likely changes on
	the assumptions.
	
	\plt{You will have to modify these tables for your problem.}
	
	\plt{The traceability matrix is not generally symmetric.  If GD1 uses A1, that
		means that GD1's derivation or presentation requires invocation of A1.  A1
		does not use GD1.  A1 is ``used by'' GD1.}
	
	\plt{The traceability matrix is challenging to maintain manually.  Please do
		your best.  In the future tools (like Drasil) will make this much easier.}

	The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on
	what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  The
	arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an
	arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a
	component is changed, the components that it points to should also be
	changed. Figure~\ref{Fig_ATrace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
	general definitions, data definitions, instance models, likely changes, and
	assumptions on each other. Figure~\ref{Fig_RTrace} shows the dependencies of
	instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each other.

	\section{Project Issues}
		\subsection{Open Issues}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Issue 1:} Users may have discomfort using an app to track their workouts over the traditional pen and paper method. The business event of tracking personal quantifiers is of concern with this issue.
				
				\item \textbf{Issue 2:} It may be unfavourable to users with existing programs and workout data to migrate to a new application.
				
				\item \textbf{Issue 3:} Users' personal methods of working out - various quirks and features - may not be covered by the app's program creation capabilities.
				
				\item \textbf{Issue 4:} There is a concern with the app’s compatibility with various devices. Integral UI/UX features of the app such has haptics, pop-ups, and dragging features may not work with various devices - hindering the overall experience for some users.
				
			\end{itemize}
		
		\subsection{Off the Shelf Solutions}
			\subsubsection{Ready Made Products}
		
				\noindent TeamBuildr
				\begin{itemize}
				\item TeamBuildr is an exercise programming app for large groups used at a professional level. Used for teams, specifically at a high level. There is no present social aspect. It is also a paid service.
				\item Program creation is a very complex process. This app has a solution that has been tried and tested by multiple users at a high level. 
				\end{itemize}
				
				\noindent JEFIT
				\begin{itemize}
				\item JEFIT lets you create and track workouts. It does not feature user-generated content but has paid template programs. It has functionality allowing users to post progress pictures. 
				\item JEFIT could be used as a foundation for adding required features if acquired.
				\end{itemize}
		
			\subsubsection{Reusable Components}
		
				\noindent One Rep Max Calculator
				\begin{itemize}
				\item The npm library one-rep-max, can be used to satisfy the requirements of providing user statistics. The library offers multiple recognized methods of calculating users' maximum weight for one repetition. 
				\item Event: Track Personal Quantifiers 
				\end{itemize}
				
				\noindent Content-Based Recommender 
				\begin{itemize}
				\item The npm library content-based-recommender can help display recommended content for the user based on user inputted parameters 
				\item This addresses the business event "filter routines". 
				\end{itemize}
		
			\subsubsection{Products that can be Copied}
		
				\noindent Exercise Directory
				\begin{itemize}
				\item Provides a bulk directory of various exercises that can be directly copied as there is no legal ownership of an exercise.
				\end{itemize}
		
				\noindent HyperHuman API 
				\begin{itemize}
				\item HyperHuman API offers pre-built workout programs that can be used as basic templates. This is especially useful in the beginning stages of the app where user generated content is at a low. 
				\item This addresses the business event "browse programs". 
				\end{itemize}
		
		\subsection{New Problems}
			Not applicable.
		\subsection{Tasks}
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Determine which technologies will be used for the creation of this project (frontend framework, server language)
			\item  app UX wire-frames
			\item  app UI design mockups
			\item  app UI components and testing using front end technology
			\item  Create skeleton of API
			\item  Revise requirement documents.
			\item  Implement test report
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
			The product will be rolled out to the Apple App store first and then added to the Google play store after it has run without issue on the app store.
			This project is new and so no transition period is relevant.
		\subsection{Risks}
			\begin{itemize}
			\item User data breach. If users data is leaked then this would have damaging ramifications for our reputation and our userbase.
			\item Failure of content moderation. Olympian is a social media application and as such is susceptible to being used for nefarious and hateful purposes. This is why content moderation will be vital in running this application.
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Costs}
			\begin{itemize}
			\item The cost of keeping a server that is always responsive to client requests. This has an estimated cost of \$25 per month.
			\item The cost of utilizing a database that can handle many reads and writes quickly. This has an estimated cost of \$10 per month.
			\item The cost of an Individual Developer Account needed to host all apps on the Apple App Store. This will cost USD\$99.
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
			N/A
		\subsection{Waiting Room}
			\begin{itemize}
			\item The product must allow users to track their diet information and recommend diets based on calory intake.
			\item The product must algorithmically produce a "Recommended" feed filled with workouts selected for users based on their habits and interests.
			\item The product must include an optional networking feature where users can view the growth of similar users and track the steps taken to produce those improvements.
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
			The product should be built using React Native along with an expressjs backend and utilizing the Google Firestore suite for app management including database and storage. Pricing was collected with these services in mind and they fullfil the needs of the product.
