\section{Project Drivers}
\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{Stakeholders}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Fitness Enthusiasts - Anyone interested in exploring other fitness routines, creating their own routines, and tracking their own personal progression towards goals.
	\item Personal Trainers - Olympian provides the ideal platform for trainers to share routines and goals with their clients.
	\item Fitness Advertisers - One avenue of monetization that Olympian could take is running advertisements. Although these advertisements could fall into any category, the largest stakeholders will be Fitness Advertisers,
	as the users of Olympian will be heavily involved with fitness, and thus most likely to buy fitness products.
\end{enumerate}

\section{General System Description}

This section provides general information about the system.  It identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user
characteristics and lists the system constraints.  \plt{This text can likely be
  borrowed verbatim.}

\plt{The purpose of this section is to provide general information about the
  system so the specific requirements in the next section will be easier to
  understand. The general system description section is designed to be
  changeable independent of changes to the functional requirements documented in
  the specific system description. The general system description provides a
  context for a family of related models.  The general description can stay the
  same, while specific details are changed between family members.}

\subsection{System Context}

\plt{Your system context will include a figure that shows the abstract view of
  the software.  Often in a scientific context, the program can be viewed
  abstractly following the design pattern of Inputs $\rightarrow$ Calculations
  $\rightarrow$ Outputs.  The system context will therefore often follow this
  pattern.  The user provides inputs, the system does the calculations, and then
  provides the outputs to the user.  The figure should not show all of the
  inputs, just an abstract view of the main categories of inputs (like material
  properties, geometry, etc.).  Likewise, the outputs should be presented from
  an abstract point of view.  In some cases the diagram will show other external
  entities, besides the user.  For instance, when the software product is a
  library, the user will be another software program, not an actual end user.
  If there are system constraints that the software must work with external
  libraries, these libraries can also be shown on the System Context diagram.
  They should only be named with a specific library name if this is required by
  the system constraint.}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{SystemContextFigure}
\caption{System Context}
\label{Fig_SystemContext} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\plt{For each of the entities in the system context diagram its responsibilities
  should be listed.  Whenever possible the system should check for data quality,
  but for some cases the user will need to assume that responsibility.  The list
  of responsibilities should be about the inputs and outputs only, and they
  should be abstract.  Details should not be presented here.  However, the
  information should not be so abstract as to just say ``inputs'' and
  ``outputs''.  A summarizing phrase can be used to characterize the inputs.
  For instance, saying ``material properties'' provides some information, but it
  stays away from the detail of listing every required properties.}

\begin{itemize}
\item User Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\end{itemize}
\item \progname{} Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Detect data type mismatch, such as a string of characters instead of a
  floating point number
\item 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Constraints}

\plt{System constraints differ from other type of requirements because they
	limit the developers' options in the system design and they identify how the
	eventual system must fit into the world. This is the only place in the SRS
	where design decisions can be specified.  That is, the quality requirement for
	abstraction is relaxed here.  However, system constraints should only be
	included if they are truly required.}

\section{Nonfunctional Requirements}

\plt{List your nonfunctional requirements.  You may consider using a fit
  criterion to make them verifiable.}
\plt{The goal is for the nonfunctional requirements to be unambiguous, abstract
  and verifiable.  This isn't easy to show succinctly, so a good strategy may be
to give a ``high level'' view of the requirement, but allow for the details to
be covered in the Verification and Validation document.}
\plt{An absolute requirement on a quality of the system is rarely needed.  For
  instance, an accuracy of 0.0101 \% is likely fine, even if the requirement is
  for 0.01 \% accuracy.  Therefore, the emphasis will often be more on
  describing now well the quality is achieved, through experimentation, and
  possibly theory, rather than meeting some bar that was defined a priori.}
\plt{You do not need an entry for correctness in your NFRs.  The purpose of the
  SRS is to record the requirements that need to be satisfied for correctness.
  Any statement of correctness would just be redundant. Rather than discuss
  correctness, you can characterize how far away from the correct (true)
  solution you are allowed to be.  This is discussed under accuracy.}

\subsection{Usability and Humanity Requirements}
\subsection{Performance Requirements}
\subsection{Operational and Environmental Requirements}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Accuracy}:]
  \textbf{Accuracy} \plt{Characterize the accuracy by giving the context/use for
    the software.  Maybe something like, ``The accuracy of the computed
    solutions should meet the level needed for $<$engineering or scientific
    application$>$.  The level of accuracy achieved by \progname{} shall be
    described following the procedure given in Section~X of the Verification and
    Validation Plan.''  A link to the VnV plan would be a nice extra.}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Usability}:] \textbf{Usability}
  \plt{Characterize the usability by giving the context/use for the software.
    You should likely reference the user characteristics section.  The level of
    usability achieved by the software shall be described following the
    procedure given in Section~X of the Verification and Validation Plan.  A
    link to the VnV plan would be a nice extra.}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Maintainability}:]
  \textbf{Maintainability} \plt{The effort required to make any of the likely
    changes listed for \progname{} should be less than FRACTION of the original
    development time.  FRACTION is then a symbolic constant that can be defined
    at the end of the report.}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Portability}:]
  \textbf{Portability} \plt{This NFR is easier to write than the others.  The
    systems that \progname{} should run on should be listed here.  When possible
    the specific versions of the potential operating environments should be
    given.  To make the NFR verifiable a statement could be made that the tests
    from a given section of the VnV plan can be successfully run on all of the
    possible operating environments.}

\item Other NFRs that might be discussed include verifiability,
  understandability and reusability.

	\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}
	
	The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
	has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
	component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
	with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:trace} shows
	the
	dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, and
	instance models with each other. Table~\ref{Table:R_trace} shows the
	dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each
	other. Table~\ref{Table:A_trace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
	general definitions, data definitions, instance models, and likely changes on
	the assumptions.
	
	\plt{You will have to modify these tables for your problem.}
	
	\plt{The traceability matrix is not generally symmetric.  If GD1 uses A1, that
		means that GD1's derivation or presentation requires invocation of A1.  A1
		does not use GD1.  A1 is ``used by'' GD1.}
	
	\plt{The traceability matrix is challenging to maintain manually.  Please do
		your best.  In the future tools (like Drasil) will make this much easier.}

	The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on
	what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  The
	arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an
	arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a
	component is changed, the components that it points to should also be
	changed. Figure~\ref{Fig_ATrace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
	general definitions, data definitions, instance models, likely changes, and
	assumptions on each other. Figure~\ref{Fig_RTrace} shows the dependencies of
	instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each other.

			\item Difference between physical and software constraints

			If you have a table of output constraints, then these are properties of a
			correct solution.
			\item Assumptions have to be invoked somewhere
			\item ``Referenced by'' implies that there is an explicit reference
			\item Think of traceability matrix, list of assumption invocations and list of
			reference by fields as automatically generatable
			\item If you say the format of the output (plot, table etc), then your

	\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}
	
	The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
	graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
		successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
		to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
		application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
		computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
		or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
		least one item for each team member.
		\item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
		question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
		mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
		member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
	\end{enumerate}
