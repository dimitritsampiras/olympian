	\section{Introduction}
	
	The purpose of this document is to identify the components of Olympian and its dependencies that could represent potential risks for Olympian's stakeholders. This document will analyze the risk levels of potentially hazardous components and their associated failures, as well as recommend actions which can be taken to eliminate the resulting risks or mitigate them to an acceptable level.
	
	\subsection{Definition of a Hazard}
	For Olympian's purposes (and throughout this document), a hazard will be defined as any condition or event which can lead to a state that is likely to negatively affect Olympian's stakeholders.
	
	\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}
	
	\section{System Boundaries and Components}

	The system upon which the Hazard Analysis will be performed on consists of the following components:

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The Olympian mobile application, which is composed of a front-end interface served by a back-end server, supports the following major functionalities: 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Profile Creation
			\item Workout Routine Creation
			\item Workout Routine Discovery and Browsing
			\item Workout Routine Reviewing
			\item Workout Progress Tracking
			\item Long Term Goal Progress Tracking
		\end{enumerate}

		\item The physical Android or iOS mobile device.

		\item The AWS Redshift Database where relational user information is stored.

	\end{enumerate}
	Although integral to the system, the physical mobile device and Redshift Database availability are not under the control of Parnas' Pals.
    The physical mobile device is manufactured by a third party company, and operated by the user. 
	The Redshift Database is operated by Amazon Web Services, making them responsible for database availability.
	
	\section{Critical Assumptions}

	\begin{itemize}

	\item The user is assumed to have the Olympian application downloaded.

	\item The user's mobile device is assumed to have internet access.

	\item The user is assumed to have basic mobile device skills such as tapping the screen and swiping.
		
	\end{itemize}

	\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
		minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
		you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
		this potential failure mode.}
	
	\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}
	\subsection{Hazards Out of Scope}
	\subsection{Failure Modes \& Effects Analysis Table}
	\wss{Include your FMEA table here}
	
	\section{Safety and Security Requirements}
	
	\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
		rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}
	
	\subsection{Access Requirements}
	\noindent 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[ACR\refstepcounter{ACRnum}\theACRnum:]
		The application must not display other users private details to the user.
		\item[ACR\refstepcounter{ACRnum}\theACRnum:]
		Only the developers and system administrators will be able to access all user details except their passwords.
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Integrity Requirements}
	\noindent 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[IR\refstepcounter{IRnum}\theIRnum:]
		Passwords must be encrypted with SHA-256 when stored.
		\item[IR\refstepcounter{IRnum}\theIRnum:]
		User data will not be modified void of user permission.
		\item[IR\refstepcounter{IRnum}\theIRnum:]
		User data will be automatically backed up to the database upon connection to the internet.
		\item[IR\refstepcounter{IRnum}\theIRnum:]
		User data transactions will be stored locally when user device is offline.
		\item[IR\refstepcounter{IRnum}\theIRnum:]
		Database will be backed up daily.
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Privacy Requirements}
	\noindent 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[PRR\refstepcounter{PRRnum}\thePRRnum:]
		The application must use OAuth protocols to verify communication between the client and server.
		\item[PRR\refstepcounter{PRRnum}\thePRRnum:]
		The application will ensure users are aware of data collection practices before collecting any data from them.
		\item[PRR\refstepcounter{PRRnum}\thePRRnum:]
		The application will communicate any changes to the privacy policy with the users.	
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Audit Requirements}
	\noindent
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[ADR\refstepcounter{ADRnum}\theADRnum:]
		Data will be stored in a secure database. When data is deleted or edited a record of this data will be kept for up to 30 days.
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Immunity Requirements}
	\noindent 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item N/A
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\section{Roadmap}
	
	\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
		Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}
	
	Based on the safety requirements listed above, the table below displays which of the requirements are planned for the current timeline of the project and those that planned implementations for the future.
